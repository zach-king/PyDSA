# Python-Data-Structures
Simple data structures implemented in Python 3. 

These implementations are based off of those written by Ken Lambert in his book, "Fundamental of Python: Data Structures."
Most of them have been modified to an extent, and a couple may not be completely functional. There are also 
"interfaces" implemented to better utilize the heirarchial approach of object-orientation.
