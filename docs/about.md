# About PyDSA
I first became interested in data structures after my first year
of college as a Computer Science student. From there I read
Ken Lambert's book, "Fundamentals of Python: Data Structures."
In Ken's book, he provides myriad chunks of code--working code
in many cases--but a full, rich Python package for data structures
and algorithms was still nowhere near complete. So I set about
making one of my own with the help of the snippets borrowed from
Ken's book.
